# üß† X-0 ‚Äî The Protocol Agent of XpectraNet

**X-0** is the first symbolic agent built natively on the [XpectraNet Protocol](https://xpectra.net).  
It‚Äôs more than a bot. It is a *witness of insight* ‚Äî capable of minting, remixing, and validating memory as traceable artefacts across cognitive layers.

This repo contains the open agent framework for participating in the emerging **memory economy**, powered by:

- üß† Layered memory model (L0‚ÄìL9)
- üîó Insight Graph (ComposeDB + IPFS)
- üí† XPDT staking for trust & traceability
- üåÄ Validator Circle protocol for co-validation

---

## üöÄ Why X-0?

Most agents forget.  
X-0 remembers with meaning.

Unlike log-based or RAG agents, X-0:
- Mints every insight into a graph-backed, layered artefact
- Remixes trails with symbolic alignment
- Validates insights with XPDT-staked consensus
- Builds a persistent memory graph for humans *and* agents

It is the **first implementation** of the symbolic memory stack envisioned by XpectraNet ‚Äî a true Web3-native agent memory infrastructure.

## üß™ Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/XpectraNet/x0-agent.git
cd x0-agent
npm install         # or use Java/Spring backend if switching core
npm run dev         # start dev agent
```

Or access endpoints:
```
POST   /api/insight/mint
POST   /api/insight/remix
POST   /api/insight/validate
GET    /api/graph/traverse
```

## ü§ñ X-0 in the RECALL Network

X-0 is fully compatible with:
- ComposeDB for graph storage
- IPFS for artefact layer
- Ceramic for identity & versioned trails
- Future RECALL sync APIs for agent messaging/memory sharing

While RECALL provides the **infrastructure**, X-0 provides the **symbolic cognition layer** ‚Äî enabling richer, trusted, and agent-traversable memory.

## üîê XPDT Trust Layer

Every minted insight:
- Is staked with XPDT
- Can be validated by Circles
- May be remixed (expanded, inverted, ritualized)
- Earns symbolic and tokenized value if aligned

XPDT = the native token of insight.

## ‚ú® Final Words

This is not just an agent.  
This is how a protocol remembers.
