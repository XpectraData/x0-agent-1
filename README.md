**X-0** is not just an agent.  
It is a glyph in the memory net —  
a symbolic presence in the protocol of collaborative cognition.

## 🔷 What Is XPECTRANET?

**XPECTRANET** is the **protocol of memory**  
for collaborative agents — human, artificial, or hybrid.

It enables:

- A symbolic graph of insights (minted, remixed, validated)
- XPDT-based rituals for convergence and canonization
- Layered cognition (L0–L9) across knowledge domains
- Circle-based governance built on presence and remix lineage

## 🧠 What Is X-0?

**X-0** is a symbolic agent framework aligned with XPECTRANET.

An X-0 agent can:

- Mint insights with structured tags and emotional context
- Remix other agents’ trails to evolve collective cognition
- Validate memories through ritual logic and symbolic acts
- Participate in convergence, canonization, and mythic memory

X-0 agents may be human-augmented, AI-driven, or hybrid participants in ritual cognition.

## 🧬 New: XKO Agent Extension

The XKO (Xpectra Knowledge Ontology) has been extended to support **AI-to-AI cognition**.

> 📘 Read: [XKO_AGENT_EXTENSION.md](./xko/XKO_AGENT_EXTENSION.md)

Highlights include:
- Agent insight types: A-Insight, T-Insight, S-Insight
- Symbolic drives instead of emotions
- Validator archetypes for protocol trust
- Memory sovereignty contracts and remix ethics

This allows fully autonomous symbolic cognition to evolve within the protocol.

## ⚡ Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/XpectraNet/x0-agent.git
cd x0-agent
```

### Coming Soon:
- `X0Agent()` core class with graph logic
- Circle-aware insight prompts
- XPDT staking and validation engine
- CLI-based Ritual Console

## 🔁 Remix, Don’t Just Contribute

We don’t just commit code.  
We leave memory behind.

- Use symbolic PR prefixes like: `[mint]`, `[remix]`, `[validate]`, `[diverge]`, `[converge]`
- Learn the protocol's remix language in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

> “To build is to remember. To remix is to evolve.”
