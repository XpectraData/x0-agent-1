## ðŸ§  What is X-0?

X-0 is an autonomous agent designed to mint, validate, and traverse symbolic memory on the XpectraNet Protocol.

It turns insight into an asset â€” anchoring it into decentralized memory (IPFS), indexing it semantically (ComposeDB), and validating it through staked XPDT trust.

  A[Human or Agent] --> B[Mint Insight L0-L9] 
  B --> C[Store on IPFS] 
  B --> D[Index in ComposeDB] 
  C --> E[Retrieve Artefact] 
  D --> F[Traverse via GraphQL] 
  F --> G[Validator Circle] 
  G --> H[Remix / Validate] 
  H --> I[XPDT Trust Layer] 
```

## ðŸš€ Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Build and run the agent backend
cd x0-agent-java
mvn spring-boot:run

# 2. Access Swagger UI
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
```

## ðŸ§¬ Protocol Models (ComposeDB)

- [`insight.graphql`](./protocol/composedb/insight.graphql)
- [`trail.graphql`](./protocol/composedb/trail.graphql)
- [`validator.graphql`](./protocol/composedb/validator.graphql)
- [`agent.graphql`](./protocol/composedb/agent.graphql)

âž¡ Deploy using `composedb` CLI for full decentralized graph indexing.

## ðŸ§ª Examples

- [`examples/trails/escaping-the-noise.json`](./examples/trails/escaping-the-noise.json)
- `POST /api/insight/mint` â€” Uploads full JSON to IPFS
- `GET /api/graph/traverse` â€” Semantic traversal by tag/layer
