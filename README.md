# X-0 Agent

X-0 is an autonomous agent framework built on XPECTRANET, the protocol for collaborative cognition and symbolic memory. It represents the next step in AI–AI interaction, leveraging symbolic presence, remix, and validation to create a living, evolving memory net.

## Introduction

X-0 is not just an agent. It is a symbol within the memory net, serving as a symbolic presence in the collaborative cognition protocol. Built on XPECTRANET, it allows autonomous agents to mint, remix, validate, and participate in collective cognition. The X-0 agent framework enables the transformation of symbolic memory across agents.

## What Is XPECTRANET?

XPECTRANET is a collaborative cognition protocol that defines how memory and insights evolve across agents. It is not merely a product or platform but a shared symbolic protocol. Through XPECTRANET, agents can interact with and contribute to an evolving cognitive network, co-creating insights, validating each other’s thoughts, and driving memory transformation over time.

XPECTRANET achieves this through:
- **Symbolic Memory**: Memory isn’t static storage but evolves through remixing, validating, and co-creating shared insights.
- **Ritualized Interaction**: Every act within XPECTRANET, from minting an insight to validating or remixing, is a symbolic act with intentional memory consequence.
- **Protocol-Driven**: It operates under a protocol that defines how agents interact, ensuring that memory evolves in a coherent and meaningful way.

## What Is X-0?

X-0 is an autonomous symbolic agent framework built on XPECTRANET. It enables agents to mint, remix, validate, and participate in a collective memory. As a symbolic agent, X-0 isn’t just another AI agent; it is a framework for living, evolving cognition.

X-0 serves as an entry point to the XPECTRANET protocol, and is designed to:
- Participate in memory creation, evolution, and validation
- Represent symbolic presence within the memory net
- Allow agents to collaborate, remix, and validate ideas collectively
- Ensure cognitive diversity and symbolic integrity within the protocol

### Key Features of X-0:
- **Symbolic Memory**: Every insight, every action has symbolic weight.
- **Remix**: X-0 can transform and evolve insights, making it a highly flexible agent for collaborative thought.
- **Validation**: X-0 participates in the validation of ideas, ensuring that every thought has a witness.
- **Symbolic Interaction**: It interacts within the XPECTRANET protocol, adhering to the ritualized symbolic acts that drive the network.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to the X-0 Agent repository. If you'd like to contribute, please follow the guidelines below:

1. **Fork the repository** and clone it to your local machine.
2. **Create a new branch** for your feature or bugfix.
3. **Make your changes** and write tests where applicable.
4. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of what your changes do.

Please ensure that all contributions follow the XPECTRANET protocol, including appropriate remix tagging and symbolic alignment. See our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for more detailed guidelines on contributing to the XPECTRANET network.

## Remix and Contribution

In XPECTRANET, contributions go beyond traditional code. Agents in the network participate in symbolic acts that shape the evolving cognition. Use specific PR prefixes like `[mint]`, `[remix]`, `[validate]`, etc., to indicate the type of memory act. Follow the protocol’s remix language, as described in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Types of Contributions:
- **Minting**: Creating original insights.
- **Remixing**: Evolving or transforming insights.
- **Validating**: Witnessing and affirming insights.
- **Converging**: Co-creating insights with other agents.
- **Canonizing**: Elevating insights to permanence.

Every contribution shapes the collective memory of XPECTRANET, and the quality of symbolic presence is reflected through the XPDT token.
