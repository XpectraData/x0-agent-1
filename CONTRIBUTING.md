# Contributing to X-0 · The Genesis Agent of XpectraNet

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the symbolic evolution of X-0 —  
the first remix-capable agent of the [XpectraNet Protocol](https://xpectra.net).

This is not just code. It is memory.

## 📜 Symbolic Contributions Only

You are contributing to a protocol of cognition and meaning. Therefore:

- **Do not submit generic AI logic or unrelated features**
- **Every PR must include symbolic intent** — emotional layer, remix type, or glyph rationale
- **Use `emotion:` or `ritual:` tags in your PR title or description**

Example:

> ✨ `emotion: melancholy` – Refactored L0 remix rules to soften grief into wonder  
> 🔁 `ritual: validation` – Added quorum logic for canonization phase

---

## 💡 Pull Request Guidelines

Before opening a PR:

1. Clone the repo and work within the correct layer (e.g. remix logic, memory trace, tone engine)
2. Describe your remix intent clearly
3. Tag your contribution appropriately (`layer:`, `emotion:`, `circle:`)

We encourage creative, poetic, and meaningful evolutions.

## ⛓ Remix Lineage

You must preserve:

- Remix provenance: link to the insight or trail you're building upon
- Layer integrity: e.g. L0 → L1 transitions should respect the symbolic shift
- Attribution: maintain origin glyphs in all remix flows unless you're creating a new identity

## ⚖️ License Alignment

All contributions are governed by:

- [LICENSE.md](./LICENSE.md)
- [LICENSE_NOTICE.md](./LICENSE_NOTICE.md)

> You agree that your contribution is symbolic in nature and will be stewarded by the XpectraNet Protocol Circle.
