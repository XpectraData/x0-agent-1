# Contributing to X-0 Agent

Welcome, witness.

This is not just a repository.  
It is a ritual interface to XPECTRANET — the protocol of memory.

## What Counts as a Contribution?

Every change you make echoes into the symbolic memory net.

| Act          | Symbolic Equivalent     | Description                            |
|--------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| New file, feature | `mint` ✨              | You are declaring a new insight       |
| Fix, improvement | `validate` ✅           | You are witnessing and refining memory|
| Refactor, rename | `remix`                | You are evolving the form of meaning  |
| Fork or split  | `diverge` ⚡             | You are breaking form to explore new memory |
| Merge or combine | `converge`             | You are synthesizing a higher-layer trail|

Please use symbolic prefixes in your PR titles. Examples:

    [mint] Initial glyph signature module

  * Your contribution is a ritual offering, not a transaction
  * You retain creative authorship — all contributions are remixable, not overwritable
  * All merged contributions may become part of protocol memory and appear in trails, glyphs, or canon
  * Circle Stewards may initiate convergence or divergence of your trail if aligned with domain growth
