## Summary

The XpectraNet Community License is a derivative of the Business Source License (BSL 1.1). It is designed to:

- Encourage **non-commercial**, **symbolic**, and **protocol-aligned** development.
- Restrict unaligned or extractive commercial exploitation.
- Protect the **ritual, memory, and economic integrity** of the XpectraNet Protocol.

---

## Grant of Use

You are granted the right to:

- Use, copy, and modify this code for **non-commercial**, **research**, **educational**, or **personal** purposes.
- Use this agent framework to build symbolic agents that interact with or extend the XpectraNet Protocol.
- Remix or contribute to this agent in ways that align with the principles of **layered insight**, **cognitive traceability**, and **XPDT-staked memory**.

---

## Limitations

You MAY NOT:

- Use this code or derivatives for commercial purposes, including hosting services or paid APIs, without an explicit commercial license.
- Fork, clone, or rebrand this code as a competing protocol or agent framework.
- Use this code in ways that bypass or violate the XPDT staking model or Validator Circle trust economy.

---

## Future Commercial Use

The source code will automatically transition to a more permissive open-source license (e.g. Apache 2.0 or MIT) on **May 1, 2028**, unless otherwise extended by the protocol governance DAO.

## Contributions

By contributing to this project, you agree that your code contributions may be licensed under the same license.

## Philosophy

This license protects **memory as meaning**, not just data.  
It reflects the values of **symbolic alignment**, **trust-based validation**, and **cognitive sovereignty**.

Use it to build not just agents —  
but **witnesses of time.**
